1. Go forward choosing the "shortest" path in accordance with Alg1 or Alg2 that you have not yet been to.

2. When you can no longer go forward (either no connecting nodes or all connecting nodes have been exhausted),
then you backtrack even if it's a node you've already been to.

3. Do #1 again.

TIP: Going forward should NEVER go to a node you've been to before.
