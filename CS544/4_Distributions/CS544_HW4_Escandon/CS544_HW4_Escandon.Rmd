## Introduction


## 1. Binomial Distribution - Perfect Score
```
Suppose a student has 40% chance of scoring a perfect score in an exam with randomly selected questions. Each student will be provided 5 attempts. 
```
```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

```
For the Binomial Distribution  - look for an event that only has two outcomes - a success/ failure, 1/0, etc.

### a. Compute and plot the probability distribution 
for the number of perfect scores over the 5 attempts
```{r 1a}

# Probability of success
p<- .40
# number of attempts
n<-5
bi<-dbinom(5,n,p)

# Probability Mass Function - shows the distribution of successes
x <- 0:n
plot(x,dbinom(x,n,p),main = "PMF for bin(5,.40)")

```

### b. Probability of exactly 2 perfect scores 
```{r 1b}
# Probability of success
p<- .40
# number of attempts
n<-5
dbinom(2,n,p)

# Calculation by formula
# Equation: f(x) = {n x} p^x(1-p)^(n-x)


```
$$f(x) = {n \choose x} p^{x} (1-p)^{n-x}$$
```{r 1bRed}
# Probability 
p<- .4
# number of attempts
x<- 2

succes<- p^x



```


### c. Probability of at least 2 perfect scores
```{r 1c}
# Use Cummulative Distr. Function
# Probability of success
p<- .40
# number of attempts
n<-2
pbinom(2,n,p)
# CDF Plot
plot(x,pbinom(x,n,p),type = "s",main = "CDF for Bin(2,.4)")
```

### d. Perfect scores for 1000 sutdents 
```{r 1d}
# Probability of success
p<- .40
n<- 5
# draw 1000 students
draws <- rbinom(1000,size = n, prob = p)
br<- (0:(n+1)) - .5
hist(draws,br,main = "Random perfect scores for 1000 students")

```

```
Question 2. Negative Binomial Distribution
```  


## 2.  Negative Binomial Distibution -
Student has 60 percent chance of a perfect score.
Suppose a student has 60% chance of scoring a perfect score in an exam with
randomly selected questions. The student has to repeatedly take the exam until they
achieve three perfect scores.
