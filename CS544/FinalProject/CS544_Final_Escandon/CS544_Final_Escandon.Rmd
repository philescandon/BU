# DataSet Introduction

The dataset that I chose to investigate was the college major dataset from Five Thiry Eight. The dataset trys to illuminate the idea of choosing a college major based on potential income level of the graduate.

Anecdotal evidence from the general public support generalities such ideas as drama majors will earn much less than an engineering major and so on. This data attempts to prove that and suggest to potential students what major course of study they might pursue if they intend to live and support themselves with a certain lifestyle.

This data was gathered from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and published in 2014, so it is 7 years old and might not be as accurate as it once was.

# Objective

The objective of this project is to investigate the major courses of study that earn the most after graduation as well as identify the majors that do not earn very much. This gives the audience an idea if the cost of college is worth it, or if a change in major and course study should be considered.

# Dataset

The dataset consists of five files that have been imported and were broken down into these categories.

-   Recent Graduates

-   Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math

-   Graduate Students

-   All Ages of College Graduates

The datasets were merged as needed.

# Examine the dataset as groups

Because there were to many majors to consider for plotting purposes, the datasets were gathered into Major Categories, such as

-   Engineering

-   Education

-   Agriculture

-   Social Science

What hypothesis do I want to investigate , prove, or illuminate.

# Exploratory Data Analysis



```{r Load libraries, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(prob)
library(plotly)
library(renv)
library(scales)
set.seed(5121)
```


```{r Load Data, message=FALSE}
majors <- read_csv("college-majors/majors-list.csv")
#head(majors)
#problems(majors)

womenStem <- read_csv("college-majors/women-stem.csv")
#head(womenStem)

allAges <- read_csv("college-majors/all-ages.csv")

gradStudents <- read_csv("college-majors/grad-students.csv")
#head(gradStudents)

recentGrads <- read_csv("college-majors/recent-grads.csv")
#head(recentGrads)

```

```{r clean, fig.height=8, fig.width= 10, include=FALSE}
#names(majors)[1] <- "Major_code"
# see what the column types are
# rename some columns so they are similiar to the other datasets
majors <- rename(majors,Major_code = FOD1P,Major_category = Major_Category)
# Change the Major code to be numeric
majors <- majors %>%  mutate_at(c(1), as.numeric)

# Distribution of median income

This bar plot can give a better sense of the distribution of the salaries.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=10, out.width='100%'}

plot_ly(recentGrads, 
        x= ~Major_category ,
        y= ~ recentGrads$Median, 
        color = ~Major_category, 
        type = 'box') %>%
  layout(title = "2014 Median Income among Recent college majors",
         xaxis = list(title = "Majors Category of Study"),
         yaxis = list (title = "Median Income"))

# only one record of 'Interdisciplinary' studies - cannot make an appropriate boxplot from this data

```

Below, this bar plot can give a general sense of the median salaries for the categories of study.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=10, out.width='100%'}
recentGrads %>% 
  group_by(Major_category) %>%
  summarize(ave=mean(Median)) %>%
  plot_ly(x=~Major_category,y=~ave,type = 'bar')%>%
  layout(title = "2014 Recent College Graduate Median Earnings",
         xaxis = list(title = "Major Category of Study"),
         yaxis = list (title = "Average Earning $"))
```

Given that not all people are motivated by money or have the interest to be a Petroleum Engineer
Another metric to consider would be the unemployment rate

## Lowest Unemployment Rate among college majors
```{r More Exploring, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=10, out.width='100%'}

# Need to plot in ascending order .. but plotly won't do it.
ue <- recentGrads %>%
  filter(Unemployment_rate>0)%>%
  group_by(Major) %>%
  summarize(Unemployment_rate) %>%
  arrange((Unemployment_rate))

#head(ue)
# top 10
#ue[1:10,]
# top 20

plot_ly(ue[1:15,],x= ~Major, y=~Unemployment_rate*100, type = 'bar')%>%
  layout(title = "2014 Lowest Unemployment among college Majors",
         xaxis = list(title = "Major of Study"),
         yaxis = list (title = "Percent Unemployed"))

```

and converserly - 
## Highest rate of unemployment among college Majors

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=10, out.width='100%' }

# How do I find the bottom 20
ueEnd <- length(ue$Major)
bottom <- 15
plot_ly( ue[(ueEnd-bottom):ueEnd,],x= ~Major, y=~Unemployment_rate*100, type = 'bar') %>%
    layout(title = "2014 Highest Unemployment among college Majors",
         xaxis = list(title = "Major of Study"),
         yaxis = list (title = "Percentage of Unemployed"))
```


From the plot above, parents might likely suggest to their children that they pick a different course or major to study.




## The Central limit Theorem
The Central Limit Theorem states that you are able to draw samples from a given dataset and the mean of those samples will follow a normal distribution, even if the original dataset is not a normal distribution.

In the following analysis I will concentrate on the 'Engineering' Major Category.
This category is composed of twenty nine different majors.  

Here is the distribution of the median salaries among the 29 sub majors in engineering.


```{r engineering, fig.height=8, fig.width=10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
recentGrads %>% group_by(Major_category) %>% filter(Major_category =='Engineering') -> rgEngineering


fit <- density(rgEngineering$Median)

plot_ly(x = rgEngineering$Median, type = "histogram",name='Histogram') %>%
add_trace(x = fit$x, y = fit$y, type = "scatter", mode = "lines", fill = "tozeroy", yaxis = "y2", name = "Density") %>% 
add_trace(x = mean(rgEngineering$Median),y = c(seq(0,12)), type = "scatter", mode = "lines", name = "Mean Salary") %>% 
  layout(yaxis2 = list(overlaying = "y", side = "right"))
```
The median is `r dollar(mean(rgEngineering$Median))`
The standard deviation is `r dollar(sd(rgEngineering$Median))`


### Simple Sampling: 500 sample of sample size 10 - 40
```{r, simple samples, fig.height=8, fig.width=10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='100%'}

}
