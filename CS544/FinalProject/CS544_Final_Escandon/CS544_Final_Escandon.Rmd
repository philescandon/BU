# DataSet Introduction

The dataset that I chose to investigate was the college major dataset from Five
Thiry Eight. The dataset trys to illuminate the idea of choosing a college major
based on potential income level of the graduate.

Anecdotal evidence from the general public support generalities such ideas as
drama majors will earn much less than an engineering major and so on. This data
attempts to prove that and suggest to potential students what major course of
study they might pursue if they intend to live and support themselves with a
certain lifestyle.

This data was gathered from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and published
in 2014, so it is 7 years old and might not be as accurate as it once was.

# Objective

The objective of this project is to investigate the major courses of study that
earn the most after graduation as well as identify the majors that do not earn
very much. This gives the audience an idea if the cost of college is worth it,
or if a change in major and course study should be considered.

# Dataset

The dataset consists of five files that have been imported and were broken down
into these categories.

-   Recent Graduates

-   Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math

-   Graduate Students

-   All Ages of College Graduates

The datasets were merged as needed.

# Examine the dataset as groups

Because there were to many majors to consider for plotting purposes, the
datasets were gathered into Major Categories, such as

-   Engineering

-   Education

-   Agriculture

-   Social Science

What hypothesis do I want to investigate , prove, or illuminate.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r Load libraries, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(prob)
library(plotly)
library(renv)
library(scales)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(corrplot)
set.seed(5121)
```

```{r Load Data, message=FALSE}
majors <- read_csv("college-majors/majors-list.csv")
#head(majors)
#problems(majors)

womenStem <- read_csv("college-majors/women-stem.csv")
#head(womenStem)

allAges <- read_csv("college-majors/all-ages.csv")

#head(recentGrads)

```

```{r clean, fig.height=8, fig.width= 10, include=FALSE}
#names(majors)[1] <- "Major_code"
# see what the column types are
# rename some columns so they are similiar to the other datasets
majors <- rename(majors,Major_code = FOD1P,Major_category = Major_Category)
# Change the Major code to be numeric
majors <- majors %>%  mutate_at(c(1), as.numeric)

# spec(majors)

```

# Distribution of median income

This bar plot can give a better sense of the distribution of the salaries.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=10, out.width='100%'}

plot_ly(recentGrads, 
        x= ~Major_category ,
        y= ~ recentGrads$Median, 
        color = ~Major_category, 
        type = 'box') %>%
  layout(title = "2014 Median Income among Recent college majors",
         xaxis = list(title = "Majors Category of Study"),
         yaxis = list (title = "Median Income"))

# only one record of 'Interdisciplinary' studies - cannot make an appropriate boxplot from this data

```

Below, this bar plot can give a general sense of the median salaries for the
categories of study.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=10, out.width='100%'}
recentGrads %>% 
  group_by(Major_category) %>%
  summarize(ave=mean(Median)) %>%
  plot_ly(x=~Major_category,y=~ave,type = 'bar')%>%
  layout(title = "2014 Recent College Graduate Median Earnings",
         xaxis = list(title = "Major Category of Study"),
         yaxis = list (title = "Average Earning $"))
```

Given that not all people are motivated by money or have the interest to be a
Petroleum Engineer Another metric to consider would be the unemployment rate

## Lowest Unemployment Rate among college majors

```{r More Exploring, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=10, out.width='100%'}

# Need to plot in ascending order .. but plotly won't do it.
ue <- recentGrads %>%
  filter(Unemployment_rate>0)%>%
  group_by(Major) %>%
  summarize(Unemployment_rate) %>%
  arrange((Unemployment_rate))

#head(ue)
# top 10
#ue[1:10,]
# top 20

plot_ly(ue[1:15,],x= ~Major, y=~Unemployment_rate*100, type = 'bar')%>%
  layout(title = "2014 Lowest Unemployment among college Majors",
         xaxis = list(title = "Major of Study"),
         yaxis = list (title = "Percent Unemployed"))

```

and converserly the highest unemployment rate is charted below. \#\# Highest
rate of unemployment among college Majors

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=10, out.width='100%' }

# How do I find the bottom 20
ueEnd <- length(ue$Major)
bottom <- 15
plot_ly( ue[(ueEnd-bottom):ueEnd,],x= ~Major, y=~Unemployment_rate*100, type = 'bar') %>%
    layout(title = "2014 Highest Unemployment among college Majors",
         xaxis = list(title = "Major of Study"),
         yaxis = list (title = "Percentage of Unemployed"))
```

From the plot above, parents might likely suggest to their children that they
pick a different course or major to study.

## The Central limit Theorem

The Central Limit Theorem states that you are able to draw random samples from a
given dataset and the mean of those samples will follow a normal distribution,
even if the original dataset is not a normal distribution. This allows us to
apply statistics that assume a normal distribution, even if the dataset is not
actually normally distributed.

In the following analysis I will concentrate on the 'Engineering' Major
Category. This category is composed of twenty nine different majors.

Here is the distribution of the median salaries among the 29 sub majors in
engineering.

```{r engineering, fig.height=8, fig.width=10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
recentGrads %>% group_by(Major_category) %>% filter(Major_category =='Engineering') -> rgEngineering


fit <- density(rgEngineering$Median)

plot_ly(x = rgEngineering$Median, type = "histogram",name='Histogram') %>%
add_trace(x = fit$x, y = fit$y, type = "scatter", mode = "lines", fill = "tozeroy", yaxis = "y2", name = "Density") %>% 
add_trace(x = mean(rgEngineering$Median),y = c(seq(0,12)), type = "scatter", mode = "lines", name = "Mean Salary") %>% 
  layout(yaxis2 = list(overlaying = "y", side = "right"))
```

The median is `r dollar(mean(rgEngineering$Median))` The standard deviation is
`r dollar(sd(rgEngineering$Median))`

### Simple Sampling: 500 sample of sample size 10 - 40

```{r, simple samples, fig.height=8, fig.width=10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
samples <- 500

# Sample size 10
sample.size <- 10
xbar10 <- numeric(samples)
for (i in 1: samples) {
	xbar10[i] <- mean(sample(rgEngineering$Median, sample.size, replace = FALSE))
}
fit <- density(xbar10)

fig1 <- plot_ly(x = xbar10, type = "histogram",name='Histogram',text = ~paste('SD: ', dollar(sd(xbar10))) ) %>%
add_trace(x = fit$x, y = fit$y, type = "scatter", mode = "lines", fill = "tozeroy", yaxis = "y2", name = "Density") %>%

  layout(yaxis2 = list(overlaying = "y", side = "right"))

# Sample Size 30
samples <- 5000
sample.size <- 30
xbar30 <- numeric(samples)
for (i in 1: samples) {
	xbar30[i] <- mean(sample(rgEngineering$Median, sample.size, replace = TRUE))
}
fit <- density(xbar30)

fig3 <- plot_ly(x = xbar30, type = "histogram",name='Histogram',text = ~paste('SD: ', dollar(sd(xbar30)))) %>%
add_trace(x = fit$x, y = fit$y, type = "scatter", mode = "lines", fill = "tozeroy", yaxis = "y2", name = "Density") %>%
add_trace(x = mean(xbar30),y = c(seq(0,65)), type = "scatter", mode = "lines", name = "Sample Size 30 Mean Salary") %>%
  layout(yaxis2 = list(overlaying = "y", side = "right"))


# Sample Size 40
samples <- 5000
sample.size <- 40
xbar40 <- numeric(samples)
for (i in 1: samples) {
	xbar40[i] <- mean(sample(rgEngineering$Median, sample.size, replace = TRUE))
}
fit <- density(xbar40)


fig4 <- plot_ly(x = xbar40, type = "histogram",name='Histogram',text = ~paste('SD: ', dollar(sd(xbar40)))) %>%
add_trace(x = fit$x, y = fit$y, type = "scatter", mode = "lines", fill = "tozeroy", yaxis = "y2", name = "Density") %>% 
add_trace(x = mean(xbar40),y = c(seq(0,65)), type = "scatter", mode = "lines", name = "Sample Size 40 Mean Salary") %>% 
  layout(yaxis2 = list(overlaying = "y", side = "right"))

### Stratified Sampling

```{r Stratified Sampling, fig.height=8, fig.width=10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
# BU ID seed
set.seed(5121)
# sample size 50
N <- nrow(rgEngineering)
n <- 500

k <- ceiling(N / n)
#k
r <- sample(k, 1)
#r

# select every kth item

s <- seq(r, by = k, length = n)

sample.3 <- rgEngineering[s, ]
#head(sample.3)

# Frequency table
t3 <- table(sample.3$Median)

#todo: Change naming convention on xaxis
barplot(t3, main =  "Engineering salaries by Frequency - Systematic Sampling", ylab = "Counts",
          ylim=range(pretty(c(0, t3))),
        las = 2,
        col="#69b3a2")

# Proportion Table
t4<- prop.table(table(sample.3$Median)) * 100
#todo: Change naming convention on xaxis
# Renaming the prop table using the t var from above.  
barplot(t4, main =  "Top salaries by Percentage - Systematic Sampling", ylab = "Percent Proportion",
          ylim=range(pretty(c(0, t4))),
        las = 2,
        col="#69b3a2")

```

## General information for choosing a major

In a general sense, choosing a major is akin to determining what you want to do
with your life, what work you would like to pursue and probably what is required
for you

To conduct some further analysis, I believe a few things should happen.

-   New data set

-   College costs should be factored in

-   Trade School professions should be considered

One simple analysis that would help expose some potential leads would be a
correlation plot.

```{r correlation, fig.height=8, fig.width=10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
# Correlation 

# Remove the factors from the tibble
recentGradsNoFactors <-recentGrads[, !sapply(recentGrads, is.character)]
recentGradsNoFactors <- drop_na(recentGradsNoFactors)

c<-cor(recentGradsNoFactors[-1])
# different view of the corr matrix.  Only include the upper and
# make it easy to visually see corr/ non-corr
corrplot(c,type = "upper",order = "hclust",col = brewer.pal(n=10,name = "Paired"))


```
