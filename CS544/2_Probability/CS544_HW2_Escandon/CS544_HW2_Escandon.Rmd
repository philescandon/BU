## Part 1 Probability

    Use the Bayes theorem to calculate the following probabilities. Show the individual steps of the
    Bayes theorem. You can use R for the calculations.  
    
    Suppose that in a particular state, among 10000 people surveyed, 4250 people are in the age
    group 18-34 years, 2850 people are in the age group 35-49 years, 1640 people are in the age
    group 50-64 years, and the remaining are 65 years & over.  
    
    Out of those in the age group 18-34 years, 1062 people had a BMI of above 30. Of those in the
    age group 35-49 years, 1710 people had a BMI of above 30. Among those in the 50-64 years
    range, 656 people had a BMI of above 30. In the last age group, 189 people had a BMI of above
    30.  
    



```{r include=FALSE}
library(prob)
library(tidyverse)
library(glue)
```

```{r 1a}
# Get my population figures
totalPop <- 10000
ageGroupPop <- c(4250,2850,1640,1260)
byPercent <- ageGroupPop/totalPop 

# Get my BMI figures

bmiGT30 <- c(1062,1710,656,189)
bmiGT30Percent <- bmiGT30 / ageGroupPop

df <- data.frame(byPercent,bmiGT30Percent)
df


```

### a.  What is the probability that a randomly selected person in this survey will have a BMI above 30?
```{r 1a2}
# P(B) = P(B|A1)*P(A1)   +  P(B|A2)*P(A2)  + P(B|A3)*P(A3)
pb <- sum(byPercent*bmiGT30Percent)
glue("Probability of randomly chosen person having a BMI > 30 is ",pb)
```



### b.  If a randomly selected person had a BMI of above 30, what is the probability of that person being in the age group 18-34 years?

```{r 1b}
# P(A1|B) = P(B|A1)* P(A1)/P(B)

PA1B=(byPercent * bmiGT30Percent)[1] / pb
glue("Probability of randomly chosen person having a BMI>30 being in the 18-34 
     age group is ", round(PA1B,digits=4))


```

### c.  If a randomly selected person had a BMI of above 30, what is the probability of that person being in the age group 35-49 years?

```{r 1c}
PA2B=(byPercent * bmiGT30Percent)[2] / pb
glue("Probability of randomly chosen person having a BMI>30 being in the 35-49 
     age group is ",round(PA2B,digits= 4))

```

### d.  If a randomly selected person had a BMI of above 30, what is the probability of that person being in the age group 50-64 years?

```{r 1d}
PA3B=(byPercent * bmiGT30Percent)[3] / pb
glue("Probability of randomly chosen person having a BMI>30 being in the 50-64 
     age group is ", round(PA3B,digits = 4))

```

### e.  If a randomly selected person had a BMI of above 30, what is the probability of that person being in the 65 years & over?

```{r 1e}
PA4B=(byPercent * bmiGT30Percent)[4] / pb
glue("Probability of randomly chosen person having a BMI>30 being in the 50-64 
     age group is ", round(PA4B,digits = 4))

```

## Part 2. Random Variables
```
    Consider a game which involves rolling three dice. Write the R code for the following.
    Using the rollDie function from the prob library, setup the sample space for this experiment with the probability space.
    For each of the following scenarios from a) through e), show the corresponding outcomes and the probability of that event. The sample outputs for b) are shown as example.
```
```{r 2Setup, include=FALSE}
library(prob)
```

### a. The sum of the rolls is greater than 10.

```{r 2a}
## Roll 3 dice and see all of the outcomes
S<- rolldie(3, makespace = TRUE)
dieSum <- subset(S,(X1+X2+X3>10) )
Prob(dieSum)

#check
# dieSum <- sum(dieSum$probs)
# head(dieSum,n=3)

```

### b.  All the three rolls are identical.
```{r 2b}
## Roll 3 dice and see all of the outcomes
S<- rolldie(3, makespace = TRUE)
A<-subset(S,(X1==X2) & (X1==X3) & (X2 == X3))
Prob(A)

# check
# sum(A$probs)
# head(A,n=3)
```

### c.  Only two of the three rolls are identical.  
```{r 2c}
S<- rolldie(3, makespace = TRUE)


# NOW take the UNION of dieEqual with A.  A comes from prob 2b.
# this will remove the x1=x2=x3 attributes

# create 3 subsets and take the union

# X1==X2, X3 not included
t<- subset(S,X1==X2 & X1 != X3)

# X1==X3, X2 not included
u<- subset(S,X1==X3 & X1 != X2)

# X2==X3, X1 not included
v<- subset(S,X2==X3 & X1 != X2)

Prob(union(t,u,v))


#check
# union(t,u,v)

```

### d. None of the three rolls are identical  
```{r 2d}
S<- rolldie(3, makespace = TRUE)
#S
dieNotEqual <- subset(S, (X1 != X2) & (X1 != X3) & (X2 != X3) )
Prob(dieNotEqual)

# sum(dieNotEqual$probs)
# head(dieNotEqual,n=3)
```


### e. Only two of the three rolls are identical given that the sum of the rolls is greater than 10. 
```{r 2e}
S<- rolldie(3, makespace = TRUE)

# X1==X2 or X1==X3 or X2==X3
A <- subset(S, (X1 == X2) | (X1 == X3) | X2 == X3  )
B <- subset(S,(X1 + X2 + X3 > 10))
Prob(intersect(A,B))

#check
# u<- intersect(A,B)
# head(u,n=3)
```

## Part 3. Functions

Using a for loop or a while loop, write your own R function, 
 sum_of_first_N_odd_squares (n),
 that returns the sum of the squares of the first n odd numbers. 

```{r notes, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# In order to use the debugger you must first create an R file from your 
# markdown and run the debugger from the R file.
# use knitr::purl( <markdown> )
#
```

### sum_of_first_N_odd_squares()
```{r 3Sum}
#' sum_of_first_N_odd_squares
#'
#' @param x Int that defines the first X odd numbers to be operated on
#'
#' @return Sum of the squares of the odd values
#' @export
#'
#' @examples  sum_of_first_N_odd_squares - returns 1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 = 165
sum_of_first_N_odd_squares <- function(x){
#create a seq for x - but DOUBLE the size since we are taking every other one
  x<-seq(1:(x*2))

  #create an empty vector for our output
  k<- c() 
  for(n in x){
    if (n %% 2 == 1){  # n %% 2 == 1 searches for the odd number
      k <- c(k,n)      # and stores them in k
    }
  }
  return (sum(k^2))
}
```

```{r}
sum_of_first_N_odd_squares(2)
sum_of_first_N_odd_squares(5)
sum_of_first_N_odd_squares(10)

```

### sum_of_first_N_odd_squaresV2()
```{r 3sumV2}
#' sum_of_first_N_odd_squaresV2
#'
#' @param x Int that defines the first X odd numbers to be operated on
#'
#' @return Sum of the squares of the odd values
#' @export
#'
#' @examples  sum_of_first_N_odd_squares - returns 1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 = 165
sum_of_first_N_odd_squaresV2 <- function(x){
#create a seq for x double the size since we are taking every other one
  x<-seq(1,(x*2),2)
  return (sum(x^2))
}
```

The output for the Version 2 function

```{r}
sum_of_first_N_odd_squaresV2(2)
sum_of_first_N_odd_squaresV2(5)
sum_of_first_N_odd_squaresV2(10)

```

## 4. Using R  
```
Initialize the Dow Jones Industrials daily closing data, dow, using the read.csv function with the
link: http://people.bu.edu/kalathur/datasets/DJI_2020.csv

```


###  Store the result of the summary function for the Close attribute as the variable sm. Change
the names of this variable so that the output appears as shown below.

```{r 4 Read In Data}
dow <- read_csv("http://people.bu.edu/kalathur/datasets/DJI_2020.csv",col_types = list(col_character(),col_double()))
head(dow)

```
### 4a. Store the result of the summary() for the *close* attribute as the variable sm.

```{r 4a}
sm <- summary(dow$Close)
names(sm)<-c("Min","Q1","Q2","Mean","Q3","Max")
sm  
```


```{r 4a2}

paste("First Quartile variation is ",sm[2]-sm[1])
paste("Second Quartile variation is ",sm[3]-sm[2])
paste("Third Quartile variation is ",sm[5]-sm[3])
paste("Fourth Quartile variation is ",sm[6]-sm[5])


```

### 4b. Produce the output for the minumum of the Dow closing value in the datset as shown

```{r 4b }
minDowClose <-min(dow$Close)
row_minDowClose <-which(dow$Close == min(dow$Close) )
date_minDowClose<- dow$Date[row_minDowClose]

paste("The minimum Dow value of ",minDowClose," is at row ",row_minDowClose," on ",date_minDowClose)

```
### 4c. Suppose you have an index fund tied to the Dow closing value. If you have invested on the minimum date, what date from the dataset you would have sold to gain the maximum percentage gain. The output is as shown below. Note that the code should be generic so that it works on any such dataset.

```{r 4c}
# Use the min values from above
# minDowClose
# date_minDowClose
# row_minDowClose

#end of the vector in use
e <- dim(dow)[1]

#slice the vector to only get a subset
w <- slice(dow, row_minDowClose: e)
maxDowClose <- max(w$Close)
# from the subset - select the max $Close value
hiRow <- which(w$Close==max(w$Close))
w[hiRow,1]

gain <-  (maxDowClose / minDowClose) - 1

paste("I would sell on ",w[hiRow,1]," when DOW is at",max(w$Close)," for a gain of ",round(gain,digits = 4)*100,"%")
```

### 4d. Use the diff function to calculate the differences between consecutive closing values in the dataset. Insert the value 0 at the beginning of these differences. Add this result as the DIFFS column of the data frame. The result is as shown below.   

```{r 4d}
# Create my new vector
cl<-diff(dow$Close)
# comparing lengths.. one is smaller than the other
length(cl)
length(dow$Close)

# Prepend a zero
cl<-prepend(cl,0)
length(cl)

# Add the diff column to the dow dataframe
dow$DIFFS<-cl
head(dow,n=6)

```

### 4e.  How many days did the Dow close higher than its previous day value?  How many days did the Dow close lower than its previous day value?

```{r 4e}

# Close higher

paste(length(dow$DIFFS[(dow$DIFFS>0)])," days DOW close higher than previous day")

# Close lower



paste(length(dow$DIFFS[(dow$DIFFS<0)])," days DOW closed lower than previous day")
```

### 4f. Show the subset of the data where there was a gain of at least 1000 points from its previous 
day value.
```{r 4f}
dow[(dow$DIFFS>1000),]
```
