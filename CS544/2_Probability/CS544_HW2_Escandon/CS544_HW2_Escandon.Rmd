## Part 1 Probability

    Use the Bayes theorem to calculate the following probabilities. Show the individual steps of the
    Bayes theorem. You can use R for the calculations.
    Suppose that in a particular state, among 10000 people surveyed, 4250 people are in the age
    group 18-34 years, 2850 people are in the age group 35-49 years, 1640 people are in the age
    group 50-64 years, and the remaining are 65 years & over.
    Out of those in the age group 18-34 years, 1062 people had a BMI of above 30. Of those in the
    age group 35-49 years, 1710 people had a BMI of above 30. Among those in the 50-64 years
    range, 656 people had a BMI of above 30. In the last age group, 189 people had a BMI of above
    30.



```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(glue)
```

```{r 1a}
# Get my population figures
totalPop <- 10000
ageGroupPop <- c(4250,2850,1640,1260)
byPercent <- ageGroupPop/totalPop 

# Get my BMI figures

bmiGT30 <- c(1062,1710,656,189)
bmiGT30Percent <- bmiGT30 / ageGroupPop

df <- data.frame(byPercent,bmiGT30Percent)
df


```

### a. What is the probability that a randomly selected person in this survey will have a BMI ofabove 30?
```{r 1a2}
# P(B) = P(B|A1)*P(A1)   +  P(B|A2)*P(A2)  + P(B|A3)*P(A3)
pb <- sum(byPercent*bmiGT30Percent)
glue("Probability of randomly chosen person having a BMI > 30 is ",pb)
```



### b. If a randomly selected person had a BMI of above 30, what is the probability of that person being in the age group 18-34 years?

```{r 1b}
# P(A1|B) = P(B|A1)* P(A1)/P(B)

PA1B=(byPercent * bmiGT30Percent)[1] / pb
glue("Probability of randomly chosen person having a BMI>30 being in the 18-34 
     age group is ", PA1B)


```

### c. If a randomly selected person had a BMI of above 30, what is the probability of that person being in the age group 35-49 years?

```{r 1c}
PA2B=(byPercent * bmiGT30Percent)[2] / pb
glue("Probability of randomly chosen person having a BMI>30 being in the 35-49 
     age group is ", PA2B)

```

### d.If a randomly selected person had a BMI of above 30, what is the probability of that person being in the age group 50-64 years?

```{r 1d}
PA3B=(byPercent * bmiGT30Percent)[3] / pb
glue("Probability of randomly chosen person having a BMI>30 being in the 50-64 
     age group is ", PA3B)

```

### e.

If a randomly selected person had a BMI of above 30, what is the probability of that person being in the 65 years & over?

```{r 1e}
PA4B=(byPercent * bmiGT30Percent)[4] / pb
glue("Probability of randomly chosen person having a BMI>30 being in the 50-64 
     age group is ", PA4B)

```

## Part 2.
```
    Consider a game which involves rolling three dice. Write the R code for the following.
    Using the rollDie function from the prob library, setup the sample space for this experiment with the probability space.
    For each of the following scenarios from a) through e), show the corresponding outcomes and the probability of that event. The sample outputs for b) are shown as example.
```
```{r 2Setup, include=FALSE}
library(prob)
```

### a. The sum of the rolls is greater than 10.

```{r 2a}
## Roll 3 dice and see all of the outcomes
S<- rolldie(3, makespace = TRUE)
#S
RollsGT10 <- subset(S,(X1 + X2 + X3)>10 )
sumRollGT10 <- sum(RollsGT10$probs)
glue('Probability of 3 die roll greater than 10 is ', sumRollGT10 )

```

### b.  All the three rolls are identical.
```{r 2b}
## Roll 3 dice and see all of the outcomes
S<- rolldie(3, makespace = TRUE)
#S
dieEqual <- subset(S, (X1 == X2) == X3 )
sum(dieEqual$probs)

```

### c.  Only two of the three rolls are identical.

### d. None of the three rolls are identical

### e.

Only two of the three rolls are identical given that the sum of the rolls is greater than 10.

## Part 3.

Using a for loop or a while loop, write your own R function, sum_of_first_N\_odd_squares (n), that returns the sum of the squares of the first n odd numbers.

    For example, if n = 5, the first five odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and the required result is
    12 + 32 + 52 + 72 + 92 = 165.
