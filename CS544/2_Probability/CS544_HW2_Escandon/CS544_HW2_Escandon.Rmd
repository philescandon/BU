## Part 1 Probability


### a. 
What is the probability that a randomly selected person in this survey will have a BMI ofabove 30?

```{r 1a}
1+1
```

### b. 
If a randomly selected person had a BMI of above 30, what is the probability of that person being in the age group 18-34 years?

```{r 1b}
1+1
```

### c. 
If a randomly selected person had a BMI of above 30, what is the probability of that person being in the age group 35-49 years? 
```{r 1c}

```

### d. 
If a randomly selected person had a BMI of above 30, what is the probability of that person being in the age group 50-64 years?
```{r 1d}

```
### e. 
If a randomly selected person had a BMI of above 30, what is the probability of that person being in the 65 years & over?
```{r 1e}

```

## Part 2.
```
Consider a game which involves rolling three dice. Write the R code for the following.
Using the rollDie function from the prob library, setup the sample space for this experiment with the probability space.
For each of the following scenarios from a) through e), show the corresponding outcomes and
the probability of that event. The sample outputs for b) are shown as example.
```
### a. 
The sum of the rolls is greater than 10.
```{r 2a}

```

### b. 
All the three rolls are identical.

### c. 
Only two of the three rolls are identical.

### d.  
None of the three rolls are identical

### e. 
Only two of the three rolls are identical given that the sum of the rolls is greater than 10.


## Part 3.
Using a for loop or a while loop, write your own R function,
sum_of_first_N_odd_squares (n), that returns the sum of the squares of the first n odd numbers. 
```
For example, if n = 5, the first five odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and the required result is
12 + 32 + 52 + 72 + 92 = 165.
```
