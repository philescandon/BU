## Introduction

```{r include=FALSE}
library(prob)
library(tidyverse)

```
```
Using some of the common prob functions to solve the simple problems described in HW assignment 2.

1. Make a probabilty space
2. use PROB to define output.
3. What do intersect and union mean in this context

```

## Using a probability space and describing events
```{r}
# Rolling  two dice 
S<- rolldie(2,makespace = TRUE)
tibble(S)

# Now create a subset of what you'd like to check
A <- subset(S,X1==3)
Prob(A)

# or just use Prob directly:

Prob(S, X1 == 3)
# whats the prob of the first die = 4 or 5
Prob(S, X1 %in% c(4,5))


```
## Making your own probabilty space 

```{r ownspace}
# make my two columns 1. outcome, 2. probability and I set up myself
# problem 2.8
outcomes<- rolldie(1)
p<- rep(1/6, times=6)

S<-probspace(outcomes, probs = p)
sum(S$probs)

```
I can set up the probabilities at my own discretion, as long as they add up to one.
The sum of the above probabilities is `r sum(S$probs)`  

Now use it
```{r}
# to remind oneself of what dataframe we are dealing with
# lets take a look
head(S,2)
# We are looking at variables X1 and probs
Prob(S,X1 == 4)
Prob(S,X1 %in% c(4,5))
Prob(S,X1 >2)

```

Another way of doing this is by using events, that is describing events as eventA , eventB, eventC and finding various combinations using these events.  

```{r}
deck <- cards(makespace = TRUE)

event1 <- subset(deck, rank %in% c("Q","K"))
# whats the prob of drawing a queen or king
Prob(event1)
# prob of drawing a card between 3-5 and is also a heart?
Prob(deck, rank %in% c(3,5,4) & suit =="Heart")

# whats the intersection of these two event?
event2 <- subset(deck,rank %in% c(3,5,4) & suit =="Heart")
Prob(union(event1,event2))

```

## Conditional Probability
```
The conditional probability rule, P(B|A), computes the probability of the event B given that the event  A has
occurred.

P(B|A) = P(A âˆ© B) / P(A)
```

To demonstrate conditional probability, consider rolling two dice
```{r}
# follow the steps from above
# 1. make a space
# 2. Use the Prob() 
S <- rolldie(2,makespace = TRUE)
head(S,n=2)

# Whats the prob of both die are equal
Prob(S,X1 == X2)

# Whats the prob of both equal given that they add up to 8
Prob(S,X1==X2, given = X1+X2==8)

# whats the prob that they equal 8 given that they are equal
Prob(S,X1+X2==8, given = X1==X2)

# You can describe these are Event A and Event B
A <- subset(S, X1 == X2)
B <- subset(S, X1 + X2 == 8)

Prob(A, given = B)
Prob(B, given = A)

```

Now lets try this with coin tosses!
```{r}
S <- tosscoin(2,makespace = TRUE)
S
# Find any HEAD in two tosses of a coin
Prob(S, isin(S,c("H")))

# Find any Head or Tails during two tosses
Prob(S, isin(S,c("H","T")))

A <- subset(S,isin(S,c("H")))
B <- subset(S,isin(S,c("H","T")))
# Prob of finding a H given H and a T was found
Prob(A, given = B)

Prob(B, given = A)


```

## Using URNSAMPLES

Define an URN that takes in one six sided die
```{r}
urnsamples(1:6,size = 2)
```
