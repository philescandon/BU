```{r}
library(tidyverse)


```
1. Select the data
```{r Read in File, include=FALSE}
podinsData <- read_table("eng_aux_podins.dat")

```

2. Select only the timestamp, valid, east, north and down velocity columns
```{r Select Columns}
eastNorthDown <- select(podinsData,1,2,10,11,12)
```
3. Rename the columns
```{r}
eastNorthDown <- rename(eastNorthDown,'timeStamp' = '245.941425','valid_data' = '00','eastV_ms' = '0.77811175465','northV_ms' = '-0.03077548956','downV_ms' = '-0.00997087512')

```

4. Filter only on valid data
```{r Filter Valid DAta}
eastNorthDownFiltered <- filter(eastNorthDown,valid_data == '01')
```

5. Add column for combined east/ north
```{r}
eastNorthDownFiltered <- mutate(eastNorthDownFiltered, comb_ms = sqrt(eastNorthDownFiltered[c(3)]^2 + eastNorthDownFiltered[c(4)]^2))

```
