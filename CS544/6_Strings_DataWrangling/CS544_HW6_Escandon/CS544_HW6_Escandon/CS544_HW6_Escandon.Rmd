## 1. Stringr and strings
```

```
```{r 1 setup}
# Read in the lincoln text and place into the words variable.
file <- "http://people.bu.edu/kalathur/datasets/lincoln.txt"
 words <- scan(file, what=character())


```

### 1 a. Detect and show all words with punctuation.
```{r 1a}
# Words with punctuation
punctWords <- words[str_detect(words, "[:punct:]")]
punctWords

```
### 1 b. Replace punctuation with space.
Remove any empty words and convert to lowercase
```{r 1b}
# replace punctuation with space

new_words<- str_remove_all(str_replace_all(punctWords,"[:punct:]","")," ")
# Could not get rid of "" and had difficulty with '--'
new_words <- new_words[new_words!='']
new_words <- str_to_lower(new_words)
new_words


```
### 1 c. Top 5 frequent words
```{r 1c}
# Find the top 5 frequently used words.
top5 <- sort(table(new_words),decreasing = TRUE)[1:5]
top5

```
### 1 d. Plot the distribution of the word frequencies of the word lengths.
```{r 1d}
# Should sort the barplot
# Barplot seems more applicable  
barplot(table(str_length(new_words)),horiz = FALSE,las = 1,xlab = 'Word Length',ylab = 'Word Count')
#hist(table(str_length(new_words)))


```
### 1 e. What are the words in the new_words data with the longest length
```{r 1e}
lenlongestWord <- str_length(new_words) %>% max()

longestWord <- new_words[str_length(new_words) == lenlongestWord]

glue::glue("The longest word is ", longestWord)

```
### 1 f. Show all words that begin with letter p 
```{r 1f}
pWords <- new_words[str_detect(new_words,"^[pP]")]
pWords

```


### 1 g. Show all words that end with a letter r 
```{r 1g}
rWords <- new_words[str_detect(new_words,"[rR]$")]
rWords

```


## Stopwords Bonus
```{r Bonus Setup}

stopfile <- "http://people.bu.edu/kalathur/datasets/stopwords.txt"
stopwords <- scan(stopfile, what=character())
```
```
Filter the stopwords from the new_words data. Use the %in% operator.
Repeat c) and d) for this data without the stop words.
```
### Bonus c. 
```{r Bonus c}
#new_words[stopwords %in% new_words]

# this is the one we want
#new_words
new_words_wo_stops <- new_words[!new_words %in% stopwords]

# Top 5 most frequent words
top5Main <- sort(table(new_words_wo_stops),decreasing = TRUE)[1:5]
barplot(top5Main,xlab = 'Word',ylab = "Count",main = "Top 5 Words in Lincoln Address")
# Frequency of the word lengths
barplot(table(str_length(new_words_wo_stops)),horiz = FALSE,las = 1,xlab = 'Word Length',ylab = 'Word Count')

```

## 2. Data Wrangling and the Tidyverse
Download the following csv file,
http://people.bu.edu/kalathur/usa_daily_avg_temps.csv
locally first and use read.csv to load the data into a data frame.

```{r 2 setup}
dailyTemps <- read_csv("usa_daily_avg_temps.csv")

```
### 2 a.   Convert the data frame into a tibble and assign it to the variable
usaDailyTemps.
```{r 2a}
usaDailyTemps <- as_tibble(dailyTemps)

```

### 2 b.  What are the maximum temperatures recorded for each year? Show the
values and also the appropriate plot for the results.  
```{r 2b}
usaDailyTemps %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(tmp = max(avgtemp))%>%
  plot_ly(x=~year,y=~tmp,type = "scatter",mode = 'lines+markers')%>%
    layout(title = "Max Temperatures recorded every year",
         xaxis = list(title = "Year"),
         yaxis = list (title = "Temperature (degrees F)"))


```

### 2 c.  What are the maximum temperatures recorded for each state? Show the values and also the appropriate plot for the results.
 
```{r 2c}
usaDailyTemps %>% 
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(tmp = max(avgtemp)) %>%
  arrange(desc(tmp)) %>%  # This portion doesn't quite work- I'd like the barplot to be ordered by temp.
  plot_ly(x = ~state)%>%
  add_trace(y=~tmp,name = 'Temp', type = 'bar')%>%
    layout(title = "High Temperatures for every State",
         xaxis = list(title = "State"),
         yaxis = list (title = "Temperature (degrees F)"))


```

### 2 d.   Filter the Boston data from usaDailyTemps and assign it to the variable bostonDailyTemps.

```{r 2d}
bostonDailyTemps <- usaDailyTemps %>% 
  filter(city=="Boston")

```

### 2 e. What are the average monthly temperatures for Boston? 
Show the values and also the appropriate plot for the results. Use the
bostonDailyTemps.  
```{r 2e}
bostonDailyTemps %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(avg = mean(avgtemp)) %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~month, y = ~avg,type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines+markers')%>%
  layout(title = "Average Temperatures in Boston",
         xaxis = list(title = "Month"),
         yaxis = list (title = "Temperature (degrees F)"))
